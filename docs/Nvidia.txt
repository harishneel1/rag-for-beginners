Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously References:[1][2]
a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at
IBM and Sun Microsystems.[23][24] In late 1992, the
three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a
Denny's roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San
Jose.[25][26][27][28]

At the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with
Sun's management and were looking to leave, but Huang was
on "firmer ground",[29] in that he was already running his
own division at LSI.[26] The three co-founders discussed a The Denny's roadside diner in San Jose,
vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang California, where Nvidia's three co-
decided to leave LSI[29] and become the chief executive founders agreed to start the company in
officer of their new startup.[26] late 1992

The three co-founders envisioned graphics-based processing
as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded
general-purpose computing methods.[29] As Huang later
explained: "We also observed that video games were
simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging
problems and would have incredibly high sales volume.
Those two conditions don't happen very often. Video games
was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets
funding huge R&D to solve massive computational
problems."[29]

Nvidia's former headquarters which was
The first problem was who would quit first. Huang's wife, home to the company through most of its
Lori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless pre-AI period (still in use)
Malachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and
Malachowsky's wife, Melody, felt the same way about



Huang.[30] Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from
Sun, effective December 31, 1992.[30] According to Priem,
this put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave
him to "flail alone", so they gave notice too.[31] Huang left
LSI and "officially joined Priem on February 17", which was
also Huang's 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in
early March.[31] In early 1993, the three founders began
working together on their new startup in Priem's townhouse
in Fremont, California.[32]

With $40,000 in the bank, the company was born.[29] The
company subsequently received $20 million of venture capital
funding from Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures and
others.[33]

During the late 1990s, Nvidia was one of 70 startup
companies pursuing the idea that graphics acceleration for Aerial view of Endeavor, the first of the

two new Nvidia headquarters buildings, in
video games was the path to the future.[25] Only two Santa Clara, California, in 2017
survived: Nvidia and ATI Technologies, the latter of which
merged into AMD.[25]

Nvidia initially had no name.[34] Priem's first idea was
"Primal Graphics", a syllabic abbreviation of two of the
founders' last names, but that left out Huang.[34] They soon
discovered it was impossible to create a workable name with
syllables from all three founders' names, after considering
"Huaprimal", "Prihuamal", "Malluapri", etc.[34] The next idea
came from Priem's idea for the name of Nvidia's first
product.[34] Priem originally wanted to call it the "GXNV", as Entrance of Endeavor headquarters

building in 2018
in the "next version" of the GX graphics chips which he had
worked on at Sun.[32] Then Huang told Priem to "drop the
GX", resulting in the name "NV".[32] Priem made a list of words with the letters "NV" in them.[34] At one
point, Malachowsky and Priem wanted to call the company NVision, but that name was already taken by
a manufacturer of toilet paper.[26] Both Priem[34] and Huang have taken credit for coming up with the
name Nvidia,[26] from "invidia", the Latin word for "envy".[29]

After the company outgrew Priem's townhouse, its original headquarters office was in Sunnyvale,
California.[29]

First graphics accelerator
Nvidia's first graphics accelerator, the NV1, was designed to process quadrilateral primitives (forward
texture mapping), a feature that set it apart from competitors, who preferred triangle primitives.[26]

However, when Microsoft introduced the DirectX platform, it chose not to support any other graphics
software and announced that its Direct3D API would exclusively support triangles.[26][35] As a result, the
NV1 failed to gain traction in the market.[36]



Nvidia had also entered into a partnership with Sega to supply the graphics chip for the Dreamcast
console and worked on the project for about a year. However, Nvidia's technology was already lagging
behind competitors. This placed the company in a difficult position: continue working on a chip that was
likely doomed to fail or abandon the project, risking financial collapse.[37]

In a pivotal moment, Sega's president, Shoichiro Irimajiri, visited Huang in person to inform him that
Sega had decided to choose another vendor for the Dreamcast. However, Irimajiri believed in Nvidia's
potential and persuaded Sega's management to invest $5 million into the company. Huang later reflected
that this funding was all that kept Nvidia afloat, and that Irimajiri's "understanding and generosity gave us
six months to live".[37]

In 1996, Huang laid off more than half of Nvidia's employees—thereby reducing headcount from 100 to
40—and focused the company's remaining resources on developing a graphics accelerator product
optimized for processing triangle primitives: the RIVA 128.[26][35] By the time the RIVA 128 was
released in August 1997, Nvidia had only enough money left for one month's payroll.[26] The sense of
impending failure became so pervasive that it gave rise to Nvidia's unofficial company motto: "Our
company is thirty days from going out of business."[26] Huang began internal presentations to Nvidia staff
with those words for many years.[26]

Nvidia sold about a million RIVA 128 units within four months,[26] and used the revenue to fund
development of its next generation of products.[35] In 1998, the release of the RIVA TNT helped solidify
Nvidia's reputation as a leader in graphics technology.[38]

Public company
Nvidia went public on January 22, 1999.[39][40][41] Investing in Nvidia after it had already failed to
deliver on its contract turned out to be Irimajiri's best decision as Sega's president. After Irimajiri left
Sega in 2000, Sega sold its Nvidia stock for $15 million.[37]

In late 1999, Nvidia released the GeForce 256 (NV10), its first product expressly marketed as a GPU,
which was most notable for introducing onboard transformation and lighting (T&L) to consumer-level
3D hardware. Running at 120 MHz and featuring four-pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video
acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed
existing products by a wide margin.

Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for
Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project took
many of its best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the
GeForce 2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In December 2000, Nvidia reached an agreement to
acquire the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, a pioneer in consumer 3D graphics technology
leading the field from the mid-1990s until 2000.[42][43] The acquisition process was finalized in April
2002.[44]

In 2001, Standard & Poor's selected Nvidia to replace the departing Enron in the S&P 500 stock index,
meaning that index funds would need to hold Nvidia shares going forward.[45]



In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software-rendering tools and
the personnel were merged into the Cg project.[46] In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for
approximately US$70 million.[47] It launched GoForce the following year. On April 22, 2004, Nvidia
acquired iReady, also a provider of high-performance TCP offload engines and iSCSI controllers.[48] In
December 2004, it was announced that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics
processor (RSX) for the PlayStation 3 game console. On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired ULI
Electronics, which at the time supplied third-party southbridge parts for chipsets to ATI, Nvidia's
competitor.[49] In March 2006, Nvidia acquired Hybrid Graphics.[50] In December 2006, Nvidia, along
with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the
U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry.[51]

2007–2014
Forbes named Nvidia its Company of the Year for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the
said period as well as during the previous five years.[52] On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it
had completed the acquisition of PortalPlayer, Inc.[53] In February 2008, Nvidia acquired Ageia,
developer of PhysX, a physics engine and physics processing unit. Nvidia announced that it planned to
integrate the PhysX technology into its future GPU products.[54][55]

In July 2008, Nvidia took a write-down of approximately $200 million on its first-quarter revenue, after
reporting that certain mobile chipsets and GPUs produced by the company had "abnormal failure rates"
due to manufacturing defects. Nvidia, however, did not reveal the affected products. In September 2008,
Nvidia became the subject of a class action lawsuit over the defects, claiming that the faulty GPUs had
been incorporated into certain laptop models manufactured by Apple Inc., Dell, and HP. In September
2010, Nvidia reached a settlement, in which it would reimburse owners of the affected laptops for repairs
or, in some cases, replacement.[56][57] On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year, $1.5 billion cross-
licensing agreement with Intel, ending all litigation between the two companies.[58]

In November 2011, after initially unveiling it at Mobile World Congress, Nvidia released its ARM-based
system on a chip for mobile devices, Tegra 3. Nvidia claimed that the chip featured the first-ever quad-
core mobile CPU.[59][60] In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire Icera, a
baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million.[61] In January 2013, Nvidia unveiled the
Tegra 4, as well as the Nvidia Shield, an Android-based handheld game console powered by the new
system on a chip.[62] On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from
STMicroelectronics.[63]

In February 2013, Nvidia announced its plans to build a new headquarters in the form of two giant
triangle-shaped buildings on the other side of San Tomas Expressway (to the west of its existing
headquarters complex). The company selected triangles as its design theme. As Huang explained in a
blog post, the triangle is "the fundamental building block of computer graphics".[64]

In 2014, Nvidia ported the Valve games Portal and Half Life 2 to its Nvidia Shield Tablet as Lightspeed
Studio.[65][66] Since 2014, Nvidia has diversified its business focusing on three markets: gaming,
automotive electronics, and mobile devices.[67]

That same year, Nvidia also prevailed in litigation brought by the trustee of 3dfx's bankruptcy estate to
challenge its 2000 acquisition of 3dfx's intellectual assets. On November 6, 2014, in an unpublished
memorandum order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the "district court's



judgment affirming the bankruptcy court's determination that [Nvidia] did not pay less than fair market
value for assets purchased from 3dfx shortly before 3dfx filed for bankruptcy".[68]

2016–2018
On May 6, 2016, Nvidia unveiled the first GPUs of the GeForce 10 series, the GTX 1080 and 1070,
based on the company's new Pascal microarchitecture. Nvidia claimed that both models outperformed its
Maxwell-based Titan X model; the models incorporate GDDR5X and GDDR5 memory respectively, and
use a 16  nm manufacturing process. The architecture also supports a new hardware feature known as
simultaneous multi-projection (SMP), which is designed to improve the quality of multi-monitor and
virtual reality (VR) rendering.[69][70][71] Laptops that include these GPUs and are sufficiently thin – as of
late 2017, under 0.8 inches (20  mm)  – have been designated as meeting Nvidia's "Max-Q" design
standard.[72]

In July 2016, Nvidia agreed to a settlement for a false advertising lawsuit regarding its GTX 970 model,
as the models were unable to use all of their advertised 4 GB of VRAM due to limitations brought by the
design of its hardware.[73] In May 2017, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota which would use
Nvidia's Drive PX-series artificial intelligence platform for its autonomous vehicles.[74] In July 2017,
Nvidia and Chinese search giant Baidu announced a far-reaching AI partnership that includes cloud
computing, autonomous driving, consumer devices, and Baidu's open-source AI framework
PaddlePaddle. Baidu unveiled that Nvidia's Drive PX 2 AI will be the foundation of its autonomous-
vehicle platform.[75]

Nvidia officially released the Titan V on December 7, 2017.[76][77]

Nvidia officially released the Nvidia Quadro GV100 on March 27, 2018.[78] Nvidia officially released the
RTX 2080 GPUs on September 27, 2018. In 2018, Google announced that Nvidia's Tesla P4 graphic
cards would be integrated into Google Cloud service's artificial intelligence.[79]

In May 2018, on the Nvidia user forum, a thread was started[80] asking the company to update users when
they would release web drivers for its cards installed on legacy Mac Pro machines up to mid-2012 5,1
running the macOS Mojave operating system 10.14. Web drivers are required to enable graphics
acceleration and multiple display monitor capabilities of the GPU. On its Mojave update info website,
Apple stated that macOS Mojave would run on legacy machines with 'Metal compatible' graphics
cards[81] and listed Metal compatible GPUs, including some manufactured by Nvidia.[82] However, this
list did not include Metal compatible cards that currently work in macOS High Sierra using Nvidia-
developed web drivers. In September, Nvidia responded, "Apple fully controls drivers for macOS. But if
Apple allows, our engineers are ready and eager to help Apple deliver great drivers for macOS 10.14
(Mojave)."[83] In October, Nvidia followed this up with another public announcement, "Apple fully
controls drivers for macOS. Unfortunately, Nvidia currently cannot release a driver unless it is approved
by Apple,"[84] suggesting a possible rift between the two companies.[85] By January 2019, with still no
sign of the enabling web drivers, Apple Insider weighed into the controversy with a claim that Apple
management "doesn't want Nvidia support in macOS".[86] The following month, Apple Insider followed
this up with another claim that Nvidia support was abandoned because of "relational issues in the
past",[87] and that Apple was developing its own GPU technology.[88] Without Apple-approved Nvidia
web drivers, Apple users are faced with replacing their Nvidia cards with a competing supported brand,
such as AMD Radeon from the list recommended by Apple.[89]



2019 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies
On March 11, 2019, Nvidia announced a deal to buy
Mellanox Technologies for $6.9 billion[90] to substantially
expand its footprint in the high-performance computing
market. In May 2019, Nvidia announced new RTX Studio
laptops. The creators say that the new laptop is going to be
seven times faster than a top-end MacBook Pro with a Core i9
and AMD's Radeon Pro Vega 20 graphics in apps like Maya
and RedCine-X Pro.[91] In August 2019, Nvidia announced
Minecraft RTX, an official Nvidia-developed patch for the
game Minecraft adding real-time DXR ray tracing exclusively Nvidia Yokneam office (former Mellanox
to the Windows 10 version of the game. The whole game is, Technologies) in Yokneam Illit, Israel, in
in Nvidia's words, "refit" with path tracing, which March 2023
dramatically affects the way light, reflections, and shadows
work inside the engine.[92]

2020–2023
In May 2020, Nvidia announced it was acquiring Cumulus Networks.[93] Post acquisition the company
was absorbed into Nvidia's networking business unit, along with Mellanox.

In May 2020, Nvidia's developed an open-source ventilator to address the shortage resulting from the
global coronavirus pandemic.[94] On May 14, 2020, Nvidia officially announced their Ampere GPU
microarchitecture and the Nvidia A100 GPU accelerator.[95][96] In July 2020, it was reported that Nvidia
was in talks with SoftBank to buy Arm, a UK-based chip designer, for $32 billion.[97]

On September 1, 2020, Nvidia officially announced the GeForce 30 series based on the company's new
Ampere microarchitecture.[98][99]

On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that they would buy Arm from SoftBank Group for $40
billion, subject to the usual scrutiny, with the latter retaining a 10% share of Nvidia.[100][101][102][103]

In October 2020, Nvidia announced its plan to build the most
powerful computer in Cambridge, England. The computer,
called Cambridge-1, launched in July 2021 with a $100
million investment and will employ AI to support healthcare
research.[104][105] According to Jensen Huang, "The
Cambridge-1 supercomputer will serve as a hub of innovation
for the UK, and further the groundbreaking work being done
by the nation's researchers in critical healthcare and drug Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, part of the
discovery."[106] RTX 20 series, which is the first

generation of Nvidia RTX
Also in October 2020, along with the release of the Nvidia
RTX A6000, Nvidia announced it is retiring its workstation
GPU brand Quadro, shifting its product name to Nvidia RTX for future products and the manufacturing
to be Nvidia Ampere architecture-based.[107]



In August 2021, the proposed takeover of Arm was stalled after the UK's Competition and Markets
Authority raised "significant competition concerns".[108] In October 2021, the European Commission
opened a competition investigation into the takeover. The Commission stated that Nvidia's acquisition
could restrict competitors' access to Arm's products and provide Nvidia with too much internal
information on its competitors due to their deals with Arm. SoftBank (the parent company of Arm) and
Nvidia announced in early February 2022 that they "had agreed not to move forward with the transaction
'because of significant regulatory challenges' ".[109] The investigation was set to end on March 15,
2022.[110][111] That same month, Nvidia was reportedly compromised by a cyberattack.[112] This would
have been the largest semiconductor acquisition in history.[17][18]

In March 2022, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that they were open to having Intel manufacture
their chips in the future.[113] This was the first time the company mentioned that they would work
together with Intel's upcoming foundry services.

In April 2022, it was reported that Nvidia planned to open a new research center in Yerevan,
Armenia.[114]

In May 2022, Nvidia opened Voyager, the second of the two giant buildings at its new headquarters
complex to the west of the old one. Unlike its smaller and older sibling Endeavor, the triangle theming is
used more "sparingly" in Voyager.[115][116]

In September 2022, Nvidia announced its next-generation automotive-grade chip, Drive Thor.[117][118]

In September 2022, Nvidia announced a collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard
related to the entire suite of Nvidia's AI-powered healthcare software suite called Clara, that includes
Parabricks and MONAI.[119]

Following U.S. Department of Commerce regulations which placed an embargo on exports to China of
advanced microchips, which went into effect in October 2022, Nvidia saw its data center chip added to
the export control list. The next month, the company unveiled a new advanced chip in China, called the
A800 GPU, that met the export control rules.[120]

In September 2023, Getty Images announced that it was partnering with Nvidia to launch Generative AI
by Getty Images, a new tool that lets people create images using Getty's library of licensed photos. Getty
will use Nvidia's Edify model, which is available on Nvidia's generative AI model library Picasso.[121]

On September 26, 2023, Denny's CEO Kelli Valade joined Huang in East San Jose to celebrate the
founding of Nvidia at Denny's on Berryessa Road, where a plaque was installed to mark the relevant
corner booth as the birthplace of a $1 trillion company.[26][122] By then, Nvidia's H100 GPUs were in
such demand that even other tech giants were beholden to how Nvidia allocated supply. Larry Ellison of
Oracle Corporation said that month that during a dinner with Huang at Nobu in Palo Alto, he and Elon
Musk of Tesla, Inc. and xAI "were begging" for H100s, "I guess is the best way to describe it. An hour of
sushi and begging".[123]

In October 2023, it was reported that Nvidia had quietly begun designing ARM-based central processing
units (CPUs) for Microsoft's Windows operating system with a target to start selling them in 2025.[124]



2024–2025
In January 2024, Forbes reported that Nvidia has increased its lobbying presence in Washington, D.C. as
American lawmakers consider proposals to regulate artificial intelligence. From 2023 to 2024, the
company reportedly hired at least four government affairs with professional backgrounds at agencies
including the United States Department of State and the Department of the Treasury. It was noted that the
$350,000 spent by the company on lobbying in 2023 was small compared to a number of major tech
companies in the artificial intelligence space.[125]

In January 2024, Raymond James Financial analysts estimated that Nvidia was selling the H100 GPU in
the price range of $25,000 to $30,000 each, while on eBay, individual H100s cost over $40,000.[126]

Several major technology companies were purchasing tens or hundreds of thousands of GPUs for their
data centers to run generative artificial intelligence projects; simple arithmetic implied that they were
committing to billions of dollars in capital expenditures.[126]

In February 2024, it was reported that Nvidia was the "hot employer" in Silicon Valley because it was
offering interesting work and good pay at a time when other tech employers were downsizing. Half of
Nvidia employees earned over $228,000 in 2023.[127] By then, Nvidia GPUs had become so valuable that
they needed special security while in transit to data centers. Cisco chief information officer Fletcher
Previn explained at a CIO summit: "Those GPUs arrive by armored car".[128]

On March 1, 2024, Nvidia became the third company in the history of the United States to close with a
market capitalization in excess of $2 trillion.[45] Nvidia needed only 180 days to get to $2 trillion from $1
trillion, while the first two companies, Apple and Microsoft, each took over 500 days.[45] On March 18,
Nvidia announced its new AI chip and microarchitecture Blackwell, named after mathematician David
Blackwell.[129]

In April 2024, Reuters reported that China had allegedly acquired banned Nvidia chips and servers from
Supermicro and Dell via tenders.[130]

In June 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department (DOJ) began antitrust
investigations into Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, focusing on their influence in the AI industry. The
FTC led the investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI, while the DOJ handled Nvidia. The probes
centered on the companies' conduct rather than mergers. This development followed an open letter from
OpenAI employees expressing concerns about the rapid AI advancements and lack of oversight.[131]

The company became the world's most valuable, surpassing Microsoft and Apple, on June 18, 2024, after
its market capitalization exceeded $3.3 trillion.[132][133]

In June 2024, Trend Micro announced a partnership with Nvidia to develop AI-driven security tools,
notably to protect the data centers where AI workloads are processed. This collaboration integrates
Nvidia NIM and Nvidia Morpheus with Trend Vision One and its Sovereign and Private Cloud solutions
to improve data privacy, real-time analysis, and rapid threat mitigation.[134]

In October 2024, Nvidia introduced a family of open-source multimodal large language models called
NVLM 1.0, which features a flagship version with 72 billion parameters, designed to improve text-only
performance after multimodal training.[135][136]

In November 2024, the company was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[137][138]



In November 2024, Morgan Stanley reported that "the entire 2025 production" of all of Nvidia's
Blackwell chips was "already sold out".[139]

Also in November 2024, the company bought 1.2 million shares of Nebius Group.[140]

Nvidia was ranked #3 on Forbes' "Best Places to Work" list in 2024.[141]

As of January 7, 2025, Nvidia's $3.66 trillion market cap was worth more than double of the combined
value of AMD, ARM, Broadcom, and Intel.[142]

In January 2025, Nvidia saw the largest one-day loss in market capitalization for a U.S. company in
history at $600 billion. This was due to DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that developed an advanced AI
model at a lower cost and computing power.[143] DeepSeek's AI assistant, using the V3 model, surpassed
ChatGPT as the highest-rated free app in the U.S. on Apple's App Store.[144][145]

On April 7, 2025, Nvidia released the Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-v1 reasoning large language
model, under the Nvidia Open Model License. It comes in three sizes: Nano, Super and Ultra.[146]

On May 28, 2025, Nvidia's second-quarter revenue forecast fell short of market estimates due to U.S.
export restrictions impacting AI chip sales to China, yet the company's stock rose 5% as investors
remained optimistic about long-term AI demand.[147]

In July 2025, it was announced that Nvidia had acquired CentL, a Canadian-based AI firm.[148]

On July 10, 2025, Nvidia closed for the first time with a market cap above $4 trillion, after its market cap
briefly touched and then retreated from that number during the previous day.[149] Nvidia became the first
company to reach a market cap of $4 trillion.[150] At that point, Nvidia was worth more than the
combined value of all publicly traded companies in the United Kingdom.[149]

On July 29, 2025, Nvidia ordered 300,000 H20 AI chips from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) due to strong demand from Chinese tech firms like Tencent and Alibaba.[151]

In August 2025, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices agreed to pay 15% of the revenues from
certain chip sales in China as part of an arrangement to obtain export licenses.[152] Nvidia will pay only
for sales of the H20 chips.[153]

Fabless manufacturing
Nvidia uses external suppliers for all phases of manufacturing, including wafer fabrication, assembly,
testing, and packaging. Nvidia thus avoids most of the investment and production costs and risks
associated with chip manufacturing, although it does sometimes directly procure some components and
materials used in the production of its products (e.g., memory and substrates). Nvidia focuses its own
resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.[154][155]

Finances
For the fiscal year 2020, Nvidia reported earnings of US$2.796 billion, with an annual revenue of
US$10.918 billion, a decline of 6.8% over the previous fiscal cycle. Nvidia's shares traded at over $531
per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$328.7 billion in January 2021. [159][160]



For the Q2 of 2020, Nvidia reported sales of $3.87 billion,
which was a 50% rise from the same period in 2019. The
surge in sales and people's higher demand for computer
technology. According to the financial chief of the
company, Colette Kress, the effects of the pandemic will
"likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends
with a greater focus on technologies, such as Nvidia
laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work Nvidia stock price (1999–2023)
and virtual collaboration."[161] In May 2023, Nvidia
crossed $1 trillion in market valuation during trading

GPU Technology Conference
Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) is a series of technical conferences held around the
world.[164] It originated in 2009 in San Jose, California, with an initial focus on the potential for solving
computing challenges through GPUs.[165] In recent years, the conference's focus has shifted to various
applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning; including self-driving cars, healthcare, high-
performance computing, and Nvidia Deep Learning Institute (DLI) training.[166] GTC 2018 attracted over
8400 attendees.[164] GTC 2020 was converted to a digital event and drew roughly 59,000 registrants.[167]

After several years of remote-only events, GTC in March 2024 returned to an in-person format in San
Jose, California.[168]

for driverless cars.[170]

BlueField, a range of data processing units, initially inherited from their acquisition of
Mellanox Technologies[171][172]

Datacenter/server class CPU, codenamed Grace, released in 2023[173][174]

DGX, an enterprise platform designed for deep learning applications
Maxine, a platform providing developers a suite of AI-based conferencing software[175]

Open-source software support
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its advanced hardware,[176]

meaning that programmers could not write free and open-source device drivers for its products without
resorting to reverse engineering.

Instead, Nvidia provides its own binary GeForce graphics drivers for X.Org and an open-source library
that interfaces with the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris kernels and the proprietary graphics software. Nvidia
also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-
dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the X.Org distribution.[177]

The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within free-software communities.
In a 2012 talk, Linus Torvalds gave a middle-finger gesture and criticized Nvidia’s stance toward
Linux."[178][179] Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers and regard Nvidia's
insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as inadequate, given that competing
manufacturers such as Intel offer support and documentation for open-source developers, and others like
AMD release partial documentation and provide some active development.[180][181]

Nvidia only provides x86/x64 and ARMv7-A versions of their proprietary driver; as a result, features like
CUDA are unavailable on other platforms.[182] Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose
artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the
company has not commented on these accusations.[183]



In 2014, with its Maxwell GPUs, Nvidia started to require firmware by them to unlock all features of its
graphics cards.[184][185][186]

On May 12, 2022, Nvidia announced that they are opensourcing their GPU kernel modules.[187][188][189]

Support for Nvidia's firmware was implemented in nouveau in 2023, which allows proper power
management and GPU reclocking for Turing and newer graphics card generations.[190][191]

In 21 July 2025, Nvidia announce to extend CUDA support to RISC-V.[192][193][194]

Deep learning
Nvidia GPUs are used in deep learning, and accelerated analytics due to Nvidia's CUDA software
platform and API which allows programmers to utilize the higher number of cores present in GPUs to
parallelize BLAS operations which are extensively used in machine learning algorithms.[11] They were
included in many Tesla, Inc. vehicles before Musk announced at Tesla Autonomy Day in 2019 that the
company developed its own SoC and full self-driving computer now and would stop using Nvidia
hardware for their vehicles.[196][197] These GPUs are used by researchers, laboratories, tech companies
and enterprise companies.[198] In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the "big bang" of deep
learning, "as deep-learning neural networks were combined with Nvidia graphics processing units
(GPUs)".[199] That year, the Google Brain team used Nvidia GPUs to create deep neural networks
capable of machine learning, where Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep
learning systems by about 100 times.[200]

DGX
DGX is a line of supercomputers by Nvidia.

In April 2016, Nvidia produced the DGX-1 based on an 8 GPU cluster, to improve the ability of users to
use deep learning by combining GPUs with integrated deep learning software.[201] Nvidia gifted its first
DGX-1 to OpenAI in August 2016 to help it train larger and more complex AI models with the capability
of reducing processing time from six days to two hours.[202][203] It also developed Nvidia Tesla K80 and
P100 GPU-based virtual machines, which are available through Google Cloud, which Google installed in
November 2016.[204] Microsoft added GPU servers in a preview offering of its N series based on Nvidia's
Tesla K80s, each containing 4992 processing cores. Later that year, AWS's P2 instance was produced
using up to 16 Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs. That month Nvidia also partnered with IBM to create a software
kit that boosts the AI capabilities of Watson,[205] called IBM PowerAI.[206][207] Nvidia also offers its own



Nvidia Deep Learning software development kit.[208] In 2017, the GPUs were also brought online at the
Riken Center for Advanced Intelligence Project for Fujitsu.[209] The company's deep learning technology
led to a boost in its 2017 earnings.[210]

In 2018, Nvidia researchers demonstrated imitation-learning techniques for industrial robots. They have
created a system that, after a short revision and testing, can already be used to control the universal robots
of the next generation. In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing
capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance
applications.[211]

Robotics
In 2020, Nvidia unveiled "Omniverse", a virtual environment designed for engineers.[212] Nvidia also
open-sourced Isaac Sim, which makes use of this Omniverse to train robots through simulations that
mimic the physics of the robots and the real world.[213][214]

In 2024, Huang oriented Nvidia's focus towards humanoid robots and self-driving cars, which he expects
to gain widespread adoption.[215][216]

In 2025, Nvidia announced Isaac GR00T N1, an open-source foundation model "designed to expedite the
development and capabilities of humanoid robots". Neura Robotics, 1X Technologies and Vention are
among the first companies to use the model.[217][218][219]

Inception Program
Nvidia's Inception Program was created to support startups making exceptional advances in the fields of
artificial intelligence and data science. Award winners are announced at Nvidia's GTC Conference. In
May 2017, the program had 1,300 companies.[220] As of March 2018, there were 2,800 startups in the
Inception Program.[221] As of August 2021, the program has over 8,500 members in 90 countries, with
cumulative funding of US$60 billion.[222]

Controversies

Maxwell advertising dispute

GTX 970 hardware specifications
Issues with the GeForce GTX 970's specifications were first brought up by users when they found out
that the cards, while featuring 4  GB of memory, rarely accessed memory over the 3.5  GB boundary.
Further testing and investigation eventually led to Nvidia issuing a statement that the card's initially
announced specifications had been altered without notice before the card was made commercially
available, and that the card took a performance hit once memory over the 3.5  GB limit were put into
use.[223][224][225]



The card's back-end hardware specifications, initially announced as being identical to those of the
GeForce GTX 980, differed in the amount of L2 cache (1.75 MB versus 2 MB in the GeForce GTX 980)
and the number of ROPs (56 versus 64 in the 980). Additionally, it was revealed that the card was
designed to access its memory as a 3.5 GB section, plus a 0.5 GB one, access to the latter being 7 times
slower than the first one.[226] The company then went on to promise a specific driver modification to
alleviate the performance issues produced by the cutbacks suffered by the card.[227] However, Nvidia
later clarified that the promise had been a miscommunication and there would be no specific driver
update for the GTX 970.[228] Nvidia claimed that it would assist customers who wanted refunds in
obtaining them.[229] On February 26, 2015, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang went on record in Nvidia's official
blog to apologize for the incident.[230] In February 2015 a class-action lawsuit alleging false advertising
was filed against Nvidia and Gigabyte Technology in the U.S. District Court for Northern
California.[231][232]

Nvidia revealed that it is able to disable individual units, each containing 256  KB of L2 cache and 8
ROPs, without disabling whole memory controllers.[233] This comes at the cost of dividing the memory
bus into high speed and low speed segments that cannot be accessed at the same time unless one segment
is reading while the other segment is writing because the L2/ROP unit managing both of the GDDR5
controllers shares the read return channel and the write data bus between the two GDDR5 controllers and
itself.[233] This is used in the GeForce GTX 970, which therefore can be described as having 3.5 GB in its
high speed segment on a 224-bit bus and 0.5 GB in a low speed segment on a 32-bit bus.[233]

On July 27, 2016, Nvidia agreed to a preliminary settlement of the U.S. class action lawsuit,[231] offering
a $30 refund on GTX 970 purchases. The agreed upon refund represents the portion of the cost of the
storage and performance capabilities the consumers assumed they were obtaining when they purchased
the card.[234]

GeForce Partner Program
The Nvidia GeForce Partner Program was a marketing program designed to provide partnering
companies with benefits such as public relations support, video game bundling, and marketing
development funds.[235] The program proved to be controversial, with complaints about it possibly being
an anti-competitive practice.[236]

First announced in a blog post on March 1, 2018,[237] it was canceled on May 4, 2018.[238]

Hardware Unboxed
On December 10, 2020, Nvidia told YouTube tech reviewer Steven Walton of Hardware Unboxed that it
would no longer supply him with GeForce Founders Edition graphics card review units.[239][240] In a
Twitter message, Hardware Unboxed said, "Nvidia have officially decided to ban us from receiving
GeForce Founders Edition GPU review samples. Their reasoning is that we are focusing on rasterization
instead of ray tracing. They have said they will revisit this 'should your editorial direction change.' "[241]

In emails that were disclosed by Walton from Nvidia Senior PR Manager Bryan Del Rizzo, Nvidia had
said:



...your GPU reviews and recommendations have continued to focus singularly on
rasterization performance, and you have largely discounted all of the other technologies we
offer gamers. It is very clear from your community commentary that you do not see things
the same way that we, gamers, and the rest of the industry do.[242]

TechSpot, partner site of Hardware Unboxed, said, "this and other related incidents raise serious
questions around journalistic independence and what they are expecting of reviewers when they are sent
products for an unbiased opinion."[242]

A number of technology reviewers came out strongly against Nvidia's move.[243][244] Linus Sebastian, of
Linus Tech Tips, titled the episode of his weekly WAN Show, "NVIDIA might ACTUALLY be
EVIL..."[245] and was highly critical of the company's move to dictate specific outcomes of technology
reviews.[246] The review site Gamers Nexus said it was, "Nvidia's latest decision to shoot both its feet:
They've now made it so that any reviewers covering RT will become subject to scrutiny from untrusting
viewers who will suspect subversion by the company. Shortsighted self-own from NVIDIA."[247]

Two days later, Nvidia reversed their stance.[248][249] Hardware Unboxed sent out a Twitter message, "I
just received an email from Nvidia apologizing for the previous email & they've now walked everything
back."[250][243] On December 14, Hardware Unboxed released a video explaining the controversy from
their viewpoint.[251] Via Twitter, they also shared a second apology sent by Nvidia's Del Rizzo that said
"to withhold samples because I didn't agree with your commentary is simply inexcusable and crossed the
line."[252][253]

Improper disclosures about cryptomining
In 2018, Nvidia's chips became popular for cryptomining, the process of obtaining crypto rewards in
exchange for verifying transactions on distributed ledgers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) said. However, the company failed to disclose that it was a "significant element" of its revenue
growth from sales of chips designed for gaming, the SEC further added in a statement and charging order.
Those omissions misled investors and analysts who were interested in understanding the impact of
cryptomining on Nvidia's business, the SEC emphasized. Nvidia, which did not admit or deny the
findings, has agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle civil charges, according to a statement made by the SEC
in May 2022.[254]

French Competition Authority Investigation
On September 26, 2023, Nvidia's French offices were searched by the French Competition Authority. The
raid, authorized by a judge, was part of an investigation into suspected anti-competitive practices in the
graphics card sector. Nvidia has not publicly commented on the incident.[255]

AI regulation dispute with Anthropic
In July 2025, a public dispute emerged between Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Anthropic CEO Dario
Amodei over AI regulation and industry practices. The conflict escalated when Amodei vehemently
denied Huang's allegations that he sought to control the AI industry through safety concerns, calling
Huang's claims an "outrageous lie."[256] The dispute centered on differing philosophies regarding AI



development, with Amodei advocating for stronger regulatory oversight and "responsible scaling
policies," while Huang promoted open-source development and criticized what Nvidia characterized as
"regulatory capture."[256] Nvidia responded by stating that "lobbying for regulatory capture against open
source will only stifle innovation, make AI less safe and secure, and less democratic."[256] The
controversy highlighted broader tensions within the AI industry between companies favoring rapid
development and those emphasizing safety measures and regulation.[256]

Proposed Shanghai facility
In May 2025, U.S. senators Jim Banks and Elizabeth Warren criticized a proposed Nvidia facility in
Shanghai, saying that it "raises significant national security and economic security issues that warrant
serious review."[257]

H20 production halt (2025)
In August 2025, Nvidia ordered suppliers to halt production of its H20 AI chip following Chinese
government directives warning domestic companies against purchasing the processor due to security
concerns.[258][259] The company directed suppliers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company, Samsung Electronics, and Amkor Technology to suspend work on the China-focused
processor.[260]

The H20 was developed in late 2023 specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export
restrictions, featuring 96GB of HBM3 memory and 4.0 TB/s memory bandwidth—higher than the H100
—but with significantly reduced computational power at 296 TFLOPs compared to the H100's 1979
TFLOPs.[261][262] Despite lower raw performance, the H20 demonstrated over 20% faster performance
than the H100 in large language model inference tasks due to architectural optimizations.[261][262]

Prior to the production halt, Nvidia had placed substantial orders for the H20, including 300,000 units
from TSMC in July 2025, driven by strong demand from Chinese technology companies.[263] CEO
Jensen Huang denied allegations that the H20 contained security backdoors, stating the chips were
designed solely for commercial use.[264] The production suspension occurred as Nvidia was developing
the B30A, a new chip based on its Blackwell architecture intended to succeed the H20 in the Chinese
market.[265]
