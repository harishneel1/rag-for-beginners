Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry
Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at

Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003 Stanford University in California, USA.[23][24][25] The project
initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan,
the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for

the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company;[26][27]

Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[28][29]



While conventional search engines ranked results by counting
how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they
theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships
among websites.[31] They called this algorithm PageRank; it
determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and
the importance of those pages that linked back to the original
site.[32][31] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing
the code to implement Page's ideas.[26] Page and Brin would
also use their friend Susan Wojcicki's garage as their office
when the search engine was set up in 1998.[33]

Then Chairman and CEO Eric Schmidt

Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine (left) with co-founders Sergey Brin
(center) and Larry Page (right) in 2008

"BackRub" because the system checked backlinks to estimate
the importance of a site.[23][34][35] Hassan, as well as
Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being
critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani
and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and
Brin the first paper about the project, describing
PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google
search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-
Molina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as
contributors to the project.[36] PageRank was
influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring Google's original homepage had a simplistic
algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by design because the company founders had little

Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent experience in HTML, the markup language used
for designing web pages[30]

including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li
later went on to create the Chinese search engine
Baidu.[37][38]

Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the
word googol,[23][39][40] a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify
that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.[41]

Google was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[23] co-
founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company
to be able to use the funds.[42][43] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because
he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the
company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page
and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front
porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco,
where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked
what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a
$250,000 investment.[44][45]

Google received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and
entrepreneur Ram Shriram.[46] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist,
for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew



Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who
told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after
Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area.
Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was
enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.[47][48]

Between these initial investors, friends and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what
allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.[49] Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD
student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.[25][50][51]

After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,[46] a new $25 million
round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,[52] with major investors including the venture capital
firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[43] Both firms were initially hesitant about investing jointly in
Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry
and Sergey however insisted on taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to
investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the
mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture
companies.[53]

Growth
In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California,[54] which is home to several
prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[55] The next year, Google began selling advertisements
associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded
search engine.[56][25] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based.[57]

In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!,
one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.[58][59]

In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an
office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
in Mountain View, California.[61] The complex became known as the
Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed
by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property
from SGI for $319  million.[62] By that time, the name "Google" had
found its way into everyday language, causing the verb "google" to be
added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford
English Dictionary, denoted as: "to use the Google search engine to
obtain information on the Internet".[63][64] The first use of the verb on
television appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.[65]

Additionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong
internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the
chairman and CEO of Google.[49] Eric was proposed by John Doerr
from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey Google's first production

server[60]
and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several
candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company.



Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay
back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer,
which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about
joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and
as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric
agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide
funds Google needed.[66]

Initial public offering
On August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Page,
Brin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024.[67] The company
opened on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol GOOGL with an offering of
19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a
system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal.[70][71] The sale of $1.67
billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[72]

On October 9, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in
Google stock,[73][74][75][76] On July 20, 2007, Google bids $4.6 billion
for the wireless-spectrum auction by the FCC.[77] On March 11, 2008,
Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1  billion, transferring to Google
valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and
advertising agencies.[78][79] By 2011, Google was handling
approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload,
Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand
servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-
changing workload more efficiently.[49]

In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google
surpassed one billion for the first time.[80][81] In May 2012, Google
acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google

to date.[82][83][84] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain from 2001 to 2011

Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless
technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,[85] mainly
Apple and Microsoft,[86] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.[87]

2012 onwards
In June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million.[88] While Waze would remain an independent
entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable
integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service.[89] Google announced the
launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur
Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the "health and well-being" company
would focus on "the challenge of ageing and associated diseases".[90]



On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire
DeepMind Technologies, a privately held AI company from
London.[91] Technology news website Recode reported that the
company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the
information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to
comment on the price.[92][93] The purchase of DeepMind aids in
Google's recent growth in the AI and robotics community.[94] In 2015,
DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a
top human pro at the game of Go.

According to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google
has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple
Inc.) in 2013,[95] 2014,[96] 2015,[97] and 2016, with a valuation of $133
billion.[98] Entrance of building where

interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Square, London

Alphabet's largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet's
Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing
Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.[99][100][101]

On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore
after he distributed a memo throughout the company that
argued bias and "Google's Ideological Echo Chamber"
clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that
it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that
cause the average woman to be less interested than men in
technical positions.[102] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused
Damore of violating company policy by "advancing harmful
gender stereotypes in our workplace", and he was fired on the
same day.[103][104][105] Current CEO, Sundar Pichai, with Prime

Minister of India, Narendra Modi

Between 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's
leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested
company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and
Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth
for the company.[106][107] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé, "How Google
Protected Andy Rubin, the 'Father of Android'". The company subsequently announced that "48
employees have been fired over the last two years" for sexual misconduct.[108] On November 1, 2018,
more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's
handling of sexual harassment complaints.[109][110] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of
the protests.[111] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal
activists.[107]

On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud
gaming platform called Google Stadia.[112]



On June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for
antitrust violations.[113] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the
company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.[114]

In December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google's new commerce
chief. Ready's role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.[115]

In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such
measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic
areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-
business essential marketing and travel.[116] Most employees were also working from home due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be
permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [117]

The 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive
among others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite
of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.[118][119][120]

In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.[121]

In January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and
Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to
close off access to its search engine in Australia.[122]

In March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia.[123] Google spent
"tens of millions of dollars" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of
their biggest games to Stadia.[124]

In April 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google ran a years-long program called "Project
Bernanke" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services.
This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in
December.[125]

In September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell
targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers,
and consumers.[126]

In 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and
email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data
only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and
medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all
search queries. It would not remove content that is "broadly useful", such as news articles, or already part
of the public record.[127]

In May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display
technology development and manufacturing Start-up company Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's
Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system
integration.[128][129]



In December 2022, Google debuted OSV-Scanner,[130][131] a Go tool for finding security holes in open
source software, which pulls from the largest open source vulnerability database of its kind to defend
against supply chain attacks.

Following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's
senior management issued a "code red"[132] and a "directive that all of its most important products—those
with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months".[133] In March 2023, in
direct response to the rapid rise of ChatGPT, Google released Bard (now Gemini), a generative artificial
intelligence chatbot.[134]

In early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These
centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company's tools, including AI
technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing
Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.[135]

In August 2024, Google would lose a lawsuit which started in 2020 in lower court, as it was found that
the company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search.[136] D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit Mehta
held that this monopoly was in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.[137] In September 2024, the EU
Court of Justice, based in Europe, would also find that Google held an illegal monopoly, in this case with
regards to its shopping search, and could not avoid paying a €2.4 billion fine.[138] The EU Court of
Justice found that Google's treatment of rival shopping searches, which the court referred to as
"discriminatory", was in violation of the Digital Markets Act.[138]

In October 2024, Google was fined by a local Russian court a symbolic 2.5 decillion dollars for allegedly
blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda. No payment was made.[139]

In November 2024, Google announced the establishment of a new AI hub in Saudi Arabia, aiming to
support the Kingdom's economic growth and technological development as part of its Vision 2030
initiative. This AI hub is projected to contribute up to $71 billion to Saudi Arabia's economy by
advancing AI-driven solutions tailored to the region's specific needs and training local talent.[140]

The partnership between Google and Saudi Arabia includes collaboration with key stakeholders, such as
the Public Investment Fund (PIF), to develop AI applications that will benefit sectors like healthcare,
finance, oil and gas, and logistics. The initiative focuses on creating localized AI technologies, with an
emphasis on integrating Arabic language capabilities and enabling widespread cloud adoption.[141]

In March 2025, Google agreed to acquire Wiz, a New York-based cybersecurity startup focusing on cloud
computing, for US$32 billion. This cash deal would be Google's biggest ever, as well as it currently being
the most expensive deal of 2025. Alphabet reportedly tried to close a deal for only $23 billion in 2024,
but this fell apart after concerns about regulatory hurdles, among other issues. Wiz, a company located in
the U.S. and Israel, was cofounded in 2020 by Assaf Rappaport. The company is backed by a number of
Silicon Valley venture capitalists, as well as notably being partnered with Amazon and Microsoft, as
listed in their website. Google reportedly said "the deal would help artificial-intelligence companies get
better security and use more than one cloud service."[142]

In July 2025, the United States Department of Defense announced that Google had received a $200
million contract for AI in the military, along with Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI.[143]



Products and services

Search engine
Google indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the
use of keywords and operators.[144] According to comScore market research from November 2009,
Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of
65.6%.[145] In May 2017, Google enabled a new "Personal" tab in Google Search, letting users search for
content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from
Google Photos.[146][147]

Google launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles
from various websites.[148] Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in
books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.[149]

Google expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002),[150]

finance (launched 2006),[151] and flights (launched 2011).[152]

Advertising
Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This
includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content
products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and
service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud
offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks
(cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017.
This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob,
AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search,
etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange.[153] In addition to its
own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google Google at ad-tech London, 2010
uses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick, to
project user interest and target advertising to the search
context and the user history.[154][155] In 2007, Google launched "AdSense for Mobile", taking advantage
of the emerging mobile advertising market.[156]

Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by
examining click rates for all the links on a page.[157] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party
websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the
Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme.[158] The sister service, Google AdSense,
allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads
are clicked.[159] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when
a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the
advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to



20  percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.[160] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google
Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security
issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility.

Generative artificial intelligence
Google had previously used virtual assistants and chatbots, such as Google Bard, prior to the
announcement of Gemini in March 2024. None of them, however, had been seen as legitimate
competitors to ChatGPT, unlike Gemini.[161] An AI training program for Google employees was also
introduced in April 2024.[162]

Google has created the text-to-image model Imagen,[163] and the text-to-video model Veo.[164] In 2025,
Google announced SynthID Detector, a tool that uses watermarking to identify whether content such as
text, images, audio, or video was generated using Google products.[165]

In 2023, Google released NotebookLM, an online tool for synthesizing documents using Gemini. In
September 2024, it gained attention for its "Audio Overview" feature, which generates podcast-like
summaries of documents.[166][167] Google also developed LearnLM, a family of language models serving
as personal AI tutors.[168]

domain names, and 24/7 support.[204]

On September 24, 2012,[205] Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business
incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup
founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships.[206] Presently, there are seven
Campus locations: Berlin, London, Madrid, Seoul, São Paulo, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw.

On March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, "a set of
integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class
marketers" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things,
the suite is designed to help "enterprise class marketers" "see the complete customer journey", generate
"useful insights", and "deliver engaging experiences to the right people".[207] Jack Marshall of The Wall
Street Journal wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies
including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.[208]



Internet services
In February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-
high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.[209][210]

Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was
moved to Alphabet's Access division.[211][212]

In April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and
cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity
and fast Internet signal.[213][214]

Financial services
In August 2023, Google became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation,
launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital
wallets.[215]

Corporate affairs

Business trends
From the financial year of 2015, figures are published for Alphabet Inc. Until 2014, the key trends of
Google were (as at the financial year ending December 31):[216][217]

Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered
19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share.[68][69] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market
capitalization of more than $23 billion.[72] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting
$350 for the first time on October 31, 2007,[222] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the
online advertising market.[223] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as
opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds.[223] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C
shares and GOOGL class A shares.[224] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the
ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth
quarter of 2015.[225]

In the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies
shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the
Internet.[226][227][228]

For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only
$112 million in licensing and other revenues.[229] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its
advertising programs.[230]

Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the
previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, "We ended 2012 with a strong quarter
... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues



for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half."[231]

Google's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89
billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter.[232] Google's Internet business was
responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on
advertisements.[233] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.[234]

Tax avoidance strategies
Google uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it
pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1
billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda.
Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for
instance, the UK is 28 per cent.[235] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer
pricing practices in 2012.[236]

In 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its
intellectual property holdings back to the U.S.[237]

Google Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of
Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.[238] In January
2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in
future.[239] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax
bill.[240]

In 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked
2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.[241]

Corporate identity
The name "Google" originated from a misspelling of
"googol",[242][243] which refers to the number represented by a 1
followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original
paper on PageRank:[36] "We chose our system name, Google, because
it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our Google's logo from 2013 to

2015. The logo had been used
goal of building very large-scale search engines." Having found its with minor changes since 1999.
way increasingly into everyday language, the verb "google" was
added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford
English Dictionary in 2006, meaning "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the
Internet."[244][64] Google's mission statement, from the outset, was "to organize the world's information
and make it universally accessible and useful",[245] and its unofficial slogan is "Don't be evil".[246] In
October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: "Do
the right thing".[247] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary
of Alphabet.

The original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin.[248] Since 1998, Google has been designing
special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events,
achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of



1998.[249][250] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in
case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry
and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point
onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed "Doodlers".[251]

Google has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google
MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.[252] In 2007, Google
announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a
connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.[253]

Google's services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef's "Bork bork bork", Pig Latin, "Hacker"
or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine.[254] When
searching for the word "anagram", meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid
words, Google's suggestion feature displays "Did you mean: nag a ram?"[255] Since 2019, Google runs
free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.[256]

Workplace culture
On Fortune magazine's list of the best companies to work for,
Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012,[257][258][259] and
fourth in 2009 and 2010.[260][261] Google was also nominated
in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to
graduating students in the Universum Communications talent
attraction index.[262] Google's corporate philosophy includes
principles such as "you can make money without doing evil",
"you can be serious without a suit", and "work should be
challenging and the challenge should be fun".[263]

Google employees marching in the Pride
in London parade in 2016

As of September  30, 2020, Alphabet Inc. had 132,121
employees,[264] of which more than 100,000 worked for
Google.[8] Google's 2020 diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68
percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian
(41.9%).[265] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held
by women.[266] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary
workers and contractors, as of March 2019.[8]

Google's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies
based on experience and can range "from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and
experienced engineers at level six".[267] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as
Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on
projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense,
originated from these independent endeavors.[268] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer,
Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all
new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.[269]

In 2005, articles in The New York Times[270] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its
anti-corporate, no evil philosophy.[271][272][273] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture,
Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and



work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on.[274] Google has also
faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees.[275][276] In 2013, a class action against
several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged "no cold call" agreements
which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees.[277] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple
employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their "conservative
political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race".[278]

On January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha
Global, was announced.[279] The coalition is made up of "13 different unions representing workers in 10
countries, including the United States, [the] United Kingdom, and Switzerland".[280] The group is
affiliated with the UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from
various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of
mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture.[280][281][278] Google had previously
been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union.[282]

In 2021, court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020, Google ran an anti-union campaign
called Project Vivian to "convince them (employees) that unions suck".[283]

In February 2025, Google dropped their commitment to make "diversity, equity, and inclusion part of
everything we do" from their annual investor report. This action followed Meta, Amazon, Pepsi,
McDonald's, Walmart and others who all have rolled back their DEI programmes.[284]

Office locations
Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California is
referred to as "the Googleplex", a play on words on the
number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a
complex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78
offices in more than 50 countries.[285]

In 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet
(27,900  m2) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in
Manhattan, New York City. The office houses its largest
advertising sales team.[286] In 2010, Google bought the Google's New York City office building

houses its largest advertising sales team.
building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the
property at around $1.9 billion.[287][288] In March 2018,
Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby
Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as
one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single
building in the history of New York.[289][290][291][292] In
November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its
New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees.[293]

Google's Toronto office
The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion,
1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) headquarters for Google
would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood.[294][295] Called Google Hudson Square, the
new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York
City.[296]



By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor,
Michigan.[297] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon's campus in Pittsburgh,
focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs.[298][299]

Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta; Austin; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts;
San Francisco; Seattle and Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington,
D.C.,[300] and Madison, Wisconsin.[301]

It also has product research and development operations in
cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location
of Google Maps)[302] and London (part of Android
development).[303] In November 2013, Google announced
plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot
office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as
one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at
the time of the deal's announcement in January,[304] Google
submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden
Council in June 2017.[305][306] In May 2015, Google Google's Dublin Ireland office,
announced its intention to create its own campus in headquarters of Google Ads for Europe
Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the
company's largest outside the United States, will
accommodate 13,000 employees.[307][308]

Google's Global Offices sum a total of 86 locations worldwide,[309] with 32 offices in North America,
three of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most
Google's offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts
with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK). The Asia Pacific region counts with 26 offices principally
five in India and three in Australia, three in China, and the Africa Middle East region counts five offices.

Infrastructure
Google has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe.[311] There is no official data on
the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a
July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers.[312] Traditionally, Google relied on
parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to
keep costs per query low.[313][314][315] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only
revealed in 2009.[315]

Google has built its own private submarine communications cables. The first cable, named Curie,
connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019.[316][317] The second fully
Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to
begin operation in 2020.[318] Google's third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon (Portugal) with
Lagos (Nigeria) and Cape Town (South Africa).[319] The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper,
connects landing points in New York (US), Bude (UK) and Bilbao (Spain), and is expected to become
operational in 2022.[320]

Environment
In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6
Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.[321][322] The
system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one
of the largest on any corporate site in the world.[321] Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality
in regard to its operations.[323]

In Spring 2009, Google hired a herd of 200 goats for a week from California Grazing to mow their lawn.
It was apparently more eco-friendly.[324]

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it "continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000
homes", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon
emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide



electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels
in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5
million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.[325]

In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million
into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate
169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes.[326] In February 2010, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates.[327] The
corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the
electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.[328]

In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20
years.[329]

In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable
energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make
Google "the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6
gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy".[330][331][332]

In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach
100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa
and one in Oklahoma.[333] In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion
wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their
green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.[334]

In September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the
company's foundation in 1998.[335] It also stated that it is committed to operating its data centers and
offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030.[336] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the
packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all
its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by
2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of
ending up in a landfill.[337]

In 2023 Google consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the
Dominican Republic, or Tunisia.[338]

Climate change denial and misinformation
Google donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the
Competitive Enterprise Institute.[339][340] The company also actively funds and profits from climate
disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites.[341] Google
continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company
updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.[342]



Philanthropy
In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of
$1 billion.[343] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public
health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle
that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program's executive director in
2004[344] and Megan Smith has since replaced him as director.[345]

In March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted
the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View.[346] In 2011, Google
donated €1 million to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International
Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).[347][348] In July 2012, Google launched a "Legalize Love"
campaign in support of gay rights.[349]

In 2008, Google announced its "project 10100", which accepted ideas for how to help the community and
then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.[350] After two years of no update, during which
many wondered what had happened to the program,[351] Google revealed the winners of the project,
giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote
education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.[352]

Responding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a
$15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens.[353] The company also decided to transform its office
in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.[354]

Also in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job
placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit
America.[355]

Criticism and controversies
Google has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax
avoidance,[356] search neutrality, copyright, censorship of
search results and content,[357] and privacy.[358][359]

Other criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of
search results, its use of other people's intellectual property,
concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's
privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as
concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly,
restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent San Francisco activists protest privately
infringement. owned shuttle buses that transport

workers for tech companies such as
Google from their homes in San
Francisco and Oakland to corporate
campuses in Silicon Valley.



Political controversy

United States
In a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a
secretive project—Project Vivian—to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming
unions.[283]

Brazil
On May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630,
which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask
congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused
the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of
economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines
of R$1 million (2023) (US$185,528.76) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed
the ad.[360][361]

Israeli–Palestinian conflict
Google is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and
Amazon provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud
computing services, including building local cloud sites that will "keep information within Israel's
borders under strict security guidelines."[362][363][364] The contract has been criticized by shareholders
and employees over concerns that the project could lead to human rights abuses against Palestinians, in
the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the disputed status of Palestinian territories.[365][366]

Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google's educational products and an outspoken critic of
the project, wrote that Google "systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices
concerned about Google's complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights—to the point of formally
retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear", and said she was retaliated against for
organizing against the project.[362][367]

In March 2024, The New York Times reported that Google Photos was being used in a facial recognition
program by Unit 8200, a surveillance unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, to surveil Palestinians in the
Gaza Strip amid the Gaza war. A Google spokesman commented that the service "does not provide
identities for unknown people in photographs".[368]

On April 18, 2024, Google dismissed 28 employees who participated in protests against the company's
involvement in Project Nimbus, which the employees argued should not be used for military or
intelligence services. The protesting employees, part of the group No Tech For Apartheid, staged sit-ins at
Google's offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California,[369] leading to disruptions and blockages within
the company facilities.[370][371] This had followed reports of Israeli forces killing large numbers of
Palestinian civilians while using own Lavender AI system to identify targets.[372][373]

On July 2025, Sergey Brin said in response to a UN report that used the term "the genocide in Gaza" and
that claimed Google profited from it: "throwing around the term genocide in relation to Gaza is deeply
offensive to many Jewish people who have suffered actual genocides. I would also be careful citing
transparently antisemitic organizations like the UN in relation to these issues".[374][375]



Russia
On October 31, 2024, the Russian government imposed a "symbolic" fine of $20 decillion on Google for
blocking pro-Russian YouTube channels. In 2022, during the invasion of Ukraine, a Russian court had
ordered Google to restore the channels, with penalties doubling every week according to TASS.[376] This
comes alongside other large fines against social media companies accused of hosting content critical of
the Kremlin or supportive of Ukraine.[377]

Antitrust
In July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down
YouTube performance on Firefox.[378][379] In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale
accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade
in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.[379]

In 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the
Reddit online community /r/degoogle.[380] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as
privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal
privacy rights by the company.

Google reportedly paid Apple $22 billion in 2022 to maintain its position as the default search engine on
Safari. It marks one of the largest payments between two tech giants in recent years.[381]

European Union
On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of
€2.42 billion from the European Union for "promoting its
own shopping comparison service at the top of search
results."[382]

On July 18, 2018,[383] the European Commission fined
Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The
abuse of dominants position has been referred to as Google's The European Commission, which
constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and imposed three fines on Google in 2017,
network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices 2018, and 2019
goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018,
Google confirmed[384] that it had appealed the fine to the
General Court of the European Union.[385]

On March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for
preventing rivals from being able to "compete and innovate fairly" in the online advertising market.
European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust
rules by "imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites" that required them to
exclude search results from Google's rivals.[386][387]

On September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal of a €4.125 billion (£3.5 billion) fine, which was ruled to
be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to
carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google has changed its
policy.[388]



In March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of
stealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese
corporations.[389] Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years,
having been hired in 2019.[390] Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned
companies, Google notified the FBI, who carried on the investigation of the data breach.[391]

On September 10, 2024, Europe's top court imposed a €2.4 billion fine on Google for abusing its
dominance in the shopping comparison market, marking the conclusion of a case that began in 2009 with
a complaint from British firm Foundem.[392]

On September 18, 2024, Alphabet's Google won a €1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine from the
European Union, while Qualcomm's efforts to repeal a penalty were unsuccessful. The General Court
agreed with many of the European Commission's findings but annulled the Google fine, stating that the
Commission failed to consider all relevant factors and did not demonstrate harm to innovation or
consumers. Google noted that it had already changed its contract practices in 2016. Meanwhile,
Qualcomm saw its fine reduced slightly but failed to overturn the ruling regarding its predatory pricing
against Icera. Both companies have options to appeal further.[393]

United States
After U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020,[394] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives'
Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October,[395] the United States Department of Justice filed an
antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its
monopoly position in web search and search advertising.[396][397] The lawsuit alleged that Google
engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion to be the default
search engine on iPhones.[398] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to "cooperate and
assist one another" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices.[399][400] Another
suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology
market.[401] In August 2024, District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that
Google held a monopoly in online search and text advertising in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman
Antitrust Act.[402][403]

On October 8, 2024, The U.S. government suggested it could request Google to divest parts of its
business, such as the Chrome browser and Android, due to its alleged monopoly in online search. The
Justice Department aimed to limit Google's growing dominance in areas like AI. Google, which intended
to appeal, argued that the proposals were too extreme, while also dealing with other antitrust cases
involving its app store and advertising operations.[404]

In November 2024, the Justice Department proposed major changes to curb Google's online search
monopoly, including forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, share search data with competitors,
and end exclusive agreements that make Google the default search engine on devices like iPhones. The
DoJ also sought a ban on Google re-entering the browser market for five years and restrictions on its
investments in rival search or AI technologies. Google called these proposals excessive and harmful to
consumers, pledging to appeal. A trial on the case was scheduled for April 2025, though the incoming
administration and new DoJ leadership could potentially alter the course of the proceedings.[405]



In September 2024, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found that Google engaged
in anti-competitive practices in the online advertising technology market, potentially harming thousands
of UK publishers and advertisers. The investigation claimed Google used its market power to prevent
rivals from competing fairly, affecting billions spent on digital ads. Google rejected the findings as
flawed, stating its ad tech benefits businesses. If found guilty, Google could face penalties of up to 10%
of its global turnover. Similar investigations are ongoing in the U.S. and EU, where regulators have
suggested that Google may need to sell part of its ad-tech business.[406]

It was ruled in 2025 by US Department of Justice alongside 17 other states that Google operates a
monopoly in online advertising technology. The case will now move to a remedies stage which may lead
to Alphabet, the owner of Google, being broken up.[407]

Gender discrimination lawsuit
In 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by
underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google
locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google
agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As
a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation
practices.[408][409][410]

Censorship
According to Ryan Gallagher of The Intercept in August 2018, Google was developing for the People's
Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) "that will blacklist
websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest".[411] Google
was grilled at a Senate committee hearing on the project one month later.[412][413] The project was
canceled in December following the backlash it garnered both externally and internally within the
company.[414][415]

Data loss
In May 2024, a misconfiguration in Google Cloud led to the accidental deletion of UniSuper's $135
billion Australian pension fund account, affecting over half a million members who were unable to access
their accounts for a week. The outage, attributed to a cloud service error and not a cyberattack, prompted
a joint apology from UniSuper and Google Cloud executives, who assured members that no personal data
was compromised and restoration efforts were underway.[416]

Data privacy
On October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to "non-public"
Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the
private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to
claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.[417][418][419]



On January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for
breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had
failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google
issued a statement saying it was "deeply committed" to transparency and was "studying the decision"
before determining its response.[420]

In November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human
Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the "mass collection of
individuals' medical records" complied with HIPAA.[421] According to The Wall Street Journal, Google
secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.[422]

In early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers,
alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history.[423][424] The lawsuit
became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling
that they must face the group's charges.[425][426] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's
CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.[427] In April 2024, it was announced
that Google agreed to settle this lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement Google agreed to destroy
billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who
thought they were browsing privately.[428]

On January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet's Google 150 million
euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of cookies along with
Facebook.[429]

In August 2024, Google sent an email to users informing them of its legal obligation to disclose certain
confidential information to U.S. government authorities. The company stated that when it receives valid
requests from government agencies to produce documents without redacting confidential customer
information, it may produce such documents even if they are confidential to users. However, it will
request confidential treatment of such information from the government.[430]

In January 2025, U.S. federal judge Richard Seeborg rejected Google's motion to dismiss a class-action
lawsuit. The lawsuit claims Google collected data from users who had specifically opted out of tracking.
The trial is scheduled for August 2025.[431]

Geolocation
Google has been criticized for continuing to collect location data from users who had turned off location-
sharing settings.[432] In 2020, the FBI used a geofence warrant to request data from Google about
Android devices near the Seattle Police Officers Guild building following an arson attempt during Black
Lives Matter protests. Google provided anonymized location data from devices in the area, which raised
privacy concerns due to the potential inclusion of unrelated protesters.[433]

Copyright infringement
On March 20, 2024, Google was fined approximately $270 million by French regulators for using content
from news outlets in France without proper disclosure to train its AI, Bard, now renamed Gemini,
violating a previous commitment to negotiate content use transparently and fairly.[434]



U.S. government contracts
Following media reports about PRISM, the NSA's massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013,
several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.[435] According to
unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.[436]

Google has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017
Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes.[437] In April 2018, thousands
of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to
end this controversial contract with the Pentagon.[438] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD
contract, which was set to expire in 2019.[439]

In 2022 Google shared a $9 billion contract from the Pentagon for cloud computing with Amazon,
Microsoft, and Oracle.[440]

Notes
a. Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has

celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September
27.[1][2][3] The shift in dates reportedly happened to celebrate index-size milestones in
tandem with the birthday.[4]
