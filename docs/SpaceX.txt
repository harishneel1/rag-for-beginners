SpaceX
Space Exploration Technologies Corp., commonly Space Exploration Technologies
referred to as SpaceX, is an American space Corp.
technology company headquartered at the Starbase
development site in Starbase, Texas.[10] Since its
founding in 2002, the company has made numerous
advances in rocket propulsion, reusable launch
vehicles, human spaceflight and satellite
constellation technology. As of 2025, SpaceX is the
world's dominant space launch provider, its launch
cadence eclipsing all others, including private
competitors and national programs like the Chinese
space program.[11] SpaceX, NASA, and the United
States Armed Forces work closely together by
means of governmental contracts.[12]

SpaceX was founded by Elon Musk in 2002 with a Company headquarters, SpaceX Starbase in

company's vision of a fully reusable, cost-effective
and adaptable launch vehicle. SpaceX is also developing its own space suit and astronaut via its Polaris
program[13] as well as developing the human lander for lunar missions under NASA's Artemis
program.[14] SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a
revenue of over $10 billion in 2024.[4]

History

2001–2004: Founding
In early 2001, Elon Musk met Robert Zubrin and donated $100,000 to his Mars Society, joining its board
of directors for a short time.[15]: 30–31  He gave a plenary talk at their fourth convention where he
announced Mars Oasis, a project to land a greenhouse and grow plants on Mars.[16][17] Musk initially
attempted to acquire a Dnepr launch vehicle for the project through Russian contacts from Jim
Cantrell[18].

Musk returned with his team to Moscow, this time bringing Michael Griffin, who later became the 11th
Administrator of NASA, but found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.[19][20] On the flight home,
Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.[20] By
applying vertical integration,[19] using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf components when
possible,[20] and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX
could significantly cut launch costs.[20]

In early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk
approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined
the position of Chief Engineer,[21]: 11  Jim Cantrell and John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey later founded
the company Vector Launch), rocket engineer Tom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.[21][22] SpaceX was
first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such as Tom
Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from
neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[23]

Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.[21]: 22 

Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of
access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[24]



2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches
SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon
1, with internal funding.[25][26] The Falcon 1 was an
expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The
total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately
$90 million[27] to $100 million.[21]: 215 

The Falcon rocket series was named after Star Wars 's
Millennium Falcon fictional spacecraft.[28]

In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) because of a sole-source The first successful Falcon 1 launch in

September 2008
contract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could
respond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed the COTS
program.[21]: 109–110 [29] In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space
program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft.[30] In
2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded $396 million to provide crew and cargo resupply
demonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under the COTS program.[31]

The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under the
DARPA Falcon Project which evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile
delivery for Prompt Global Strike.[26][32][33] The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and
2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as
well,[34] and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same
time.[21]: 178–182  Musk was reportedly "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain" because
of the stress.[21]: 216 

The financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved on the fourth
attempt on September 28, 2008. Musk split his remaining $30 million between SpaceX and Tesla, and
NASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract awarding $1.6 billion to SpaceX
in December, thus financially saving the company.[21]: 217–221  Based on these factors and the further
business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth
total, launch in July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a
larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[35] Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at the
time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with the NASA Associate Administrator
Bill Gerstenmaier.[36][21]: 222 

2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts
SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity
vehicle, the Falcon 5.[37] The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the
Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated by NASA, which
committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This
started with seed money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in
2006.[38] The overall contract award was $278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon



spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9
with Dragon.[38] As part of this contract, the Falcon 9
launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon
Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon
spacecraft.

The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in
December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's 0:00

second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits,
completing all its mission objectives.[39] By December 2010,
the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 Video of the first launch of Falcon 9

and Dragon every three months.[40]

In April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA
issued a $75 million contract for SpaceX to develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in
preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[41] NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-
price Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in
August 2012.[42]

In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk[43] and his seventy million
shares were then estimated to be worth $875  million on private markets,[44] valuing SpaceX at
$1.3  billion.[45] In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch, Dragon became the first commercial
spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.[46] After the flight, the company private
equity valuation nearly doubled to $2.4 billion or $20/share.[47][48] By that time, SpaceX had operated on
total funding of approximately $1  billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity
provided approximately $200  million, with Musk investing approximately $100  million and other
investors having put in about $100 million.[49]

SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects
of the landing technology.[50] The Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL).
High-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[50]

2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth
SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine
contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[51] That year Arianespace requested that
European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition from SpaceX.[52][53]

Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S.
military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch provider
United Launch Alliance (ULA).[54] The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise
to over $400 million over the years.[55] In September 2014, NASA's Director of Commercial Spaceflight,
Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to
finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and
certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after
certification.[42]



In January 2015, SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and
Fidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company,
establishing the company valuation at approximately $12  billion.[56]

The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite
constellation, called Starlink, to provide global broadband internet
service with 4,000 satellites.[57]

The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the
seventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the
flight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that
held a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of
acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to
escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.[58]

2015–2017: Reusability milestones Launch of Falcon 9 carrying
ORBCOMM OG2-M1, July

SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage 2014
in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20.[59] In April 2016, the
company achieved the first successful landing on the
autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still
Love You in the Atlantic Ocean.[60] By October 2016,
following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they
were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they
choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first
stage.[61]

A second major rocket failure happened in early September
2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill Falcon 9 first stage on an autonomous
operation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The spaceport drone ship (ASDS) barge after

payload, the AMOS-6 communications satellite valued at the first successful landing at sea,

$200 million, was destroyed.[62] The explosion was caused by SpaceX CRS-8 mission

the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold
that it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.[63] Though not considered an
unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it
worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[64]

In March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a
re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[65] The first stage was recovered again,
also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[66]

2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider
In July 2017, the company raised $350  million, which raised its valuation to $21  billion.[67] In 2017,
SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[68] By March
2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about $12  billion in contract
revenue.[69] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[70] This
made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[71]



In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[72] and began work to construct a short test
tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of
SpaceX employees,[73] which was completed in May 2018,[74] and opened to the public in December
2018.[75] During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the
equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon
Musk.[75]

Since 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general
In 2019 SpaceX raised $1.33  billion of capital across three funding rounds.[76] By May 2019, the
valuation of SpaceX had risen to $33.3 billion[77] and reached $36 billion by March 2020.[78]

On August 19, 2020, after a $1.9 billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by
any privately held company, SpaceX's valuation increased to $46 billion.[79][80][81]

In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional $1.61 billion in an equity round from 99 investors[82] at a
per share value of approximately $420,[81] raising the company valuation to approximately $74 billion.
By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than $6 billion in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since
2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the
development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[82] By October 2021, the valuation of
SpaceX had risen to $100.3 billion.[83] On April 16, 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical
role in the NASA crewed spaceflight Artemis program.[84] By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements
with Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking
services for Starlink.[85] A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at $127 billion.[86]

In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named A Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster from
CRS-23 on it for the first time on August 29, 2021.[87] Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18
rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On December 13, 2021, company CEO Elon Musk
announced that the company was starting a carbon dioxide removal program that would convert captured
carbon into rocket fuel,[88][89] after he announced a $100 million donation to the X Prize Foundation the
previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the best carbon
capture technology.[90][91]

In August 2022, Reuters reported that the European Space Agency (ESA) began initial discussions with
SpaceX that could lead to the company's launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked
access to Soyuz rockets amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[92] Since that invasion and in the greater
war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlink was extensively used.[93]

In 2022, SpaceX's Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle
type in a single year.[94][95] SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61
launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.[94]

In November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplier Pioneer Aerospace out of
bankruptcy for $2.2 million.[96][97]

On July 16, 2024, Elon Musk posted on X that SpaceX would move its headquarters from Hawthorne,
California, to SpaceX Starbase in Brownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed
California AB1955 bill "and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies".[98]



This new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes
to a student's sexual orientation and gender identity.[99] The headquarters officially moved to
Brownsville, Texas in August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.[100]

The move to relocate SpaceX's headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The
Hawthorne facility continues to support the company's Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX's
workhorse product in 2024.[101]

SpaceX's 2024 Polaris Dawn mission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major
milestone in commercial space exploration.[102]

In 2025 ProPublica reported that Chinese investors were investing in SpaceX via offshore entities, such
as the Cayman Islands. Experts speculated that this might raise national security concerns with
regulators.[103]

By July 2025, as part of $5 Billion equity raise SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI.[104]

Starship
In January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance the Starship
and Starlink projects.[105] The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans
and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.[106] SpaceX's Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket
ever flown, with a planned payload capacity of 100+ tons.[107][108] Construction of initial prototypes and
tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved
to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year.

On April 20, 2023, Starship's first orbital flight test ended in a mid-air explosion over the Gulf of Mexico
before booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the
vehicle to reach max q later than planned. "Max q" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress
which occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-
destructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost
control and spun erratically until the automated flight termination system was activated, which
intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space
industry have referred to the test flight as a success.[109][110]

Musk said at the time that it would take "six to eight weeks" to get the infrastructure prepared for another
launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the
next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project's progress,
adding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon.[111][112]

On November 18, 2023, SpaceX launched Starship on its second flight test, with both vehicles flying for
a few minutes before separately exploding.[113][114][115][116]

In early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting March 14 as the tentative launch date for its
next uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a "launch license" by the
FAA. This license was granted on March 13, 2024.[117] On March 14, 2024, at 13:25 UTC, Starship



launched for the third time and for the first time Starship reached its
planned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster
experiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being
lost during re-entry over the Indian Ocean.[107][108]

On June 4, 2024, SpaceX received the launch license for Starship's
fourth flight test. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first
time that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch
subsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that
they met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of
hardware. The provision could prove to speed the development
timeline.[118]

On October 12, 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval for Starship's
fifth flight test.[119] The flight was the first without engine failures, and
the first successful tower catch.[120]

SpaceX launched Starship on its sixth flight test on November 19,
2024.[121] The booster aborted the catch attempt, while the ship
conducted a relight in space.[122][123]

On January 16, 2025, SpaceX launched Starship on its seventh flight
test, with the first Block 2 Ship, Ship 33 (standing at 403  ft or 123
meters). This test also carried a demonstration payload, a Starlink V3
simulator. The test launched at 22:37 UTC. The test resulted in the
second catch of the Super Heavy booster, B14, but after 8 minutes,
SpaceX lost contact with 'Ship', which is the upper stage of the Starship
which resulted in the failure of the ship during the ascent. The
spacecraft reportedly exploded around 8.5 minutes after launch over
the Atlantic Ocean near the Turks and Caicos Islands. The FAA, on Starship in launch position
January 18, required a mishap investigation of the failure.[124]

On March 7, 2025, SpaceX launched another Starship rocket,
this time from Texas. Contact was lost minutes into the test
flight and the spacecraft came tumbling down and broke
apart, with wreckage seen across Florida's skies.[125] As per
preliminary investigation, Starship’s 7th test flight was
disrupted by an oxygen leak, flashes and sustained fires in its
aft section, which caused the rocket’s engines to shut down
and turn on the spacecraft’s self-destruct system.[126]

On June 18, 2025, a SpaceX Starship rocket exploded during Dragon's Flight: SpaceX Crew-10
launches aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9

a static fire test at the company’s Starbase facility in Texas, rocket carrying the Dragon spacecraft
following what the company described as a “major piloted by astronaut and Air Force Maj.
anomaly”.[127]

Crewed launches
A significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when
SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug
Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon
spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the
first private company to send astronauts to the International
Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch
from American soil in 9 years.[128][129] The mission launched
from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A)
in Florida.[130]

In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60
Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become
the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[131] In 2022, most SpaceX
launches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming
satellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit.[132]

On July 16, 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquire Swarm Technologies, a private company
building a low Earth orbit satellite constellation for communications with Internet of things (IoT) devices,
for $524 million.[133][134]

In December 2022, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the launch of up to
7,500 of SpaceX's next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.[135]

Launch vehicles
SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The
small-lift Falcon 1 was the first launch vehicle
developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-lift
Falcon 9 and the heavy-lift Falcon Heavy are both
operational.

Falcon 1 was a small rocket capable of placing
several hundred kilograms into low Earth orbit. It
launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which
two were successful.[156] The Falcon 1 was the first
privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach The landing of a Falcon 9 Block 5 first stage at
orbit.[136] Cape Canaveral in July 2019. VTVL technologies

are used in many of SpaceX's launch vehicles.
Falcon 9 is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of
delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to orbit,
competing with the Delta IV and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world.
It has nine Merlin engines in its first stage. The Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket successfully reached orbit on its first
attempt on June 4, 2010. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on May 22, 2012, and launched
the first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).[46] The
vehicle was upgraded to Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9
Block 5 in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and
flown again.[157]

Falcon Heavy is a heavy-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 63,800 kg (140,700 lb) to Low
Earth orbit (LEO) or 26,700 kg (58,900 lb) to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). It uses three slightly
modified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27 Merlin 1D engines.[158][159] The Falcon Heavy
successfully flew its inaugural mission on February 6, 2018, launching Musk's personal Tesla Roadster
into heliocentric orbit.[160]



Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for the National Security Space
Launch (NSSL).[161][162] As of August 22, 2025, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 529
times, resulting in 526 full mission successes, one partial success, and one in-flight failure. In addition, a
Falcon 9 experienced a pre-flight failure before a static fire test in 2016.[163][164]

SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known as Starship. It comprises a
reusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage space vehicle. As of 2017,
the system was intended to supersede the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early
2020s.[165][166]

Rocket engines
Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company
has developed several rocket engines  – Merlin,
Kestrel, and Raptor  – for use in launch
vehicles,[167][168] Draco for the reaction control
system of the Dragon series of spacecraft,[169] and
SuperDraco for abort capability in Crew Dragon.[170]

Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid
oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants. Merlin was first
used to power the Falcon 1's first stage and is now
used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Merlin 1D engine undergoes a test at SpaceX's
vehicles.[171] Kestrel uses the same propellants and Rocket Development and Test Facility in

was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second-stage main McGregor, Texas

engine.[168][172]

Draco and SuperDraco are hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on the
reaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 spacecraft.[169] The SuperDraco engine is more
powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft
during an abort scenario.[173]

Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle
engines to power the first and second stages of the in-development Starship launch system.[167]

Development versions were test-fired in late 2016,[174] and the engine flew for the first time in 2019,
powering the Starhopper vehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft).[175]

Dragon spacecraft
SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space
Station (ISS).

The first-generation Dragon 1 spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with
financial support from NASA under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program.
After a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive a Commercial
Resupply Services (CRS) contract.[39]



The currently operational second-generation Dragon 2
spacecraft conducted its first flight, without crew, to the ISS
in early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in
2020.[128] It was developed with financial support from
NASA under the Commercial Crew Program program. The
cargo variant of Dragon 2 flew for the first time in December
2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract
with NASA.[176]

In March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as SpaceX Dragon 2 spacecraft, designed

a resupply spacecraft for NASA's planned Lunar Gateway to deliver crew and cargo to and from the
International Space Station (cargo

space station under a Gateway Logistics Services (GLS) version shown)
contract.[177] Dragon XL is planned to launch on the Falcon
Heavy, and is able to transport over 5,000 kg (11,000  lb) to
the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.[178]

SpaceX designed a spacesuit to be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible
depressurization.[179] On May 4, 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed for extravehicular
activity, planned to be used for a spacewalk during the Polaris Dawn mission.[180]

Autonomous spaceport drone ships
SpaceX routinely returns the first stage of Falcon 9
and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The
rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using
only its propulsion systems.[181] When propellant
margins do not permit a return to a launch site
(RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform
in the ocean, called autonomous spaceport drone ships
(ASDS).[182]

SpaceX also had plans to introduce floating launch
platforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a
sea launch option for their Starship launch vehicle. As Autonomous spaceport drone ship in position

of February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but prior to CRS-6 mission

had not ruled out sea-based platforms for future
use.[183]

Starlink
Starlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly
owned subsidiary of SpaceX,[9][184] that consists of thousands of cross-linked communications satellites
in ~550 km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband
capabilities.[185] Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on
the SpaceX Paz satellite mission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites
aboard a Falcon 9.[186] Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020[187] and first orders



were taken in early 2021.[188] Customers were told to
expect internet service speeds of 50  Mbit/s to
150 Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.[189] In
December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million
subscribers worldwide.[190]

The planned large number of Starlink satellites has
been criticized by astronomers due to concerns over
light pollution,[191][192][193] with the brightness of
Starlink satellites in both optical and radio Sixty Starlink satellites stacked together before

wavelengths interfering with scientific deployment

observations.[194] In response, SpaceX has
implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.[195] The large
number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris
collisions.[196][197] However, the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow
them to de-orbit at the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on
uplinked tracking data.[198]

In December 2022, SpaceX announced Starshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity
payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. The Space Development Agency is a key customer
procuring satellites for a space-based missile defense system.[199][200]

In June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the "Starlink Mini",
designed for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for $599 in an early access release, it was more
expensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard
version, featured a built-in WiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download
speeds.[201]

Other projects

Hyperloop
In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a
1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.[202][203]

The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019.[204]

COVID-19 antibody-testing program
In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in
the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to
provide blood samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as
coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection
against the virus.[205][206]



Other
In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children
stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[207] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team,
encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened.
However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's
involvement "distracted from the rescue effort".[208][209] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company
built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally
delivered it to Thailand.[210][211] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it
wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[207]

Facilities
SpaceX is headquartered at the SpaceX Starbase near Brownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and
launches its Starship vehicle. However most of the company's operations are based out of its office in
Hawthorne, California where it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon
spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control.

The company also operates a Starlink satellite manufacturing facilities in Redmond, Washington, a rocket
development and test facility in McGregor, Texas,[212] and maintains an office in the Washington, D.C.
area, close to key government customers.[213]

SpaceX has two active launch sites in Florida, one active launch site in California and one active launch
site at Starbase in Texas.

Hawthorne, CA: Falcon and Dragon manufacturing, mission control
SpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles
suburb of Hawthorne, California. The three-story
building, originally built by Northrop Corporation to
build Boeing 747 fuselages,[214] houses SpaceX's
office space, mission control, and Falcon 9
manufacturing facilities.[215]

The area has one of the largest concentrations of
space sector headquarters, facilities, and subsidiaries
in the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell Douglas
main satellite building campuses, The Aerospace SpaceX office in Hawthorne, California at night
Corporation, Raytheon, NASA's Jet Propulsion during a Falcon 9 launch from Vandenberg Space

Laboratory, United States Space Force's Space Force Base

Systems Command at Los Angeles Air Force Base,
Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman, and AECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace
engineers and recent college engineering graduates.[214]

SpaceX uses a high degree of vertical integration in the production of its rockets and rocket engines.[19]

SpaceX builds its rocket engines, rocket stages, spacecraft, principal avionics and all software in-house in
their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry.[19]



The Hawthorne facility was SpaceX's headquarters until August 2024. However, the move to relocate
SpaceX's headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term, as the facility will remain
to the company's operations.[216]

Starbase, TX: Starship manufacturing, launch
SpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from the
SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica near Brownsville, Texas,
having announced first plans for the launch facility in August
2014.[217][218] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
issued the permit in July 2014.[219] SpaceX broke ground on
the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up
in the latter half of 2015,[220] with the first suborbital
launches from the facility in 2019[215] and orbital launches
starting in 2023.

The Starship assembly building at
SpaceX has faced increased scrutiny over the environmental SpaceX Starbase in Texas
impact of its Starbase facility.[221][222][223] In August 2024,
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality cited
SpaceX for violating environmental regulations by repeatedly releasing pollutants into water near the
Boca Chica launch site.[224] The EPA fined SpaceX approximately $150,000 for allegedly discharging
"industrial wastewater" and violating the Clean Water Act.[225]

McGregor, TX: Rocket Development and Test Facility
SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility in
McGregor, Texas is a rocket engine test facility. Every
rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX
must pass through McGregor for final testing being
used on flight missions.[226][227] The facility also
serves as a testing ground for various components and
engines during the research and development
process.[228] In addition to engine testing, after
splashdown and recovery, Dragon spacecraft make a
stop at McGregor to have their hazardous hypergolic
propellant fuels removed, before the capsules Aerial view of the SpaceX McGregor engine

continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment.[226] testing facility, 2008

SpaceX calls the facility the most advanced and active
rocket engine test facility in the world, and said that as of 2024, over 7,000 tests had been conducted at
the facility since it opened, with seven engine test fires on a typical day, across more than a dozen test
stands.[229] Despite its low-profile compared to the company's other facilities, is a critical part of
SpaceX's operations, and company president and COO Gwynne Shotwell maintains her primary office in
McGregor.[230][226]



Originally the site of the Bluebonnet Ordnance Plant during World War II,[228] the facility was later used
by Beal Aerospace before being leased by SpaceX in 2003.[231] The company has since expanded it
significantly from 256 acres (104 ha) in 2003[228] to 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) by 2015.[229] In July 2021,
SpaceX announced plans to build a second production facility for Raptor engines at McGregor. This
expansion is expected to significantly increase SpaceX's production capacity, with the goal of producing
800 to 1,000 Raptor engines per year.[232][233]

Starlink manufacturing facilities
SpaceX's Starlink subsidiary operates over two main facilities. Satellite
manufacturing takes place near Seattle, Washington while user terminal
manufacturing takes place near Austin, Texas.

Starlink's satellite development and manufacturing operations campus
occupies over 314,000 square feet (29,200 m2) in at least six buildings
located in Redmond, Washington, east of Seattle. The first building
opened in early 2015,[234] and the company later expanded into five
buildings on the Redmond Ridge Corporate Center.[235][236]

Starlink opened a user terminal manufacturing facility just outside of
Bastrop, Texas, east of Austin in December 2023. In its first nine
months of operation, the one-million-square-foot (93,000  m2) facility
produced one million user terminals and was on track to become the
largest factory for printed circuit boards in the United States.[237]

Launch facilities Starlink user terminal on the
sidewalk of a residential home.

SpaceX operates four orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space
Force Station and Kennedy Space Center in Florida and
Vandenberg Space Force Base in California for Falcon
rockets, and Starbase near Brownsville, Texas for Starship.
SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the
four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch
business to fill each pad.[238] The Vandenberg launch site
enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape
Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination
(28.5–55°).[239] Larger inclinations, including SSO, are
possible from Florida by overflying Cuba.[240] Falcon Heavy Side Boosters landing on

LZ1 and LZ2 at Cape Canaveral

Before it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches took place at the
Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek
Island of the Marshall Islands.[241]

In April 2007, the Pentagon approved the use of Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) by
SpaceX.[242] The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and
geostationary orbits. The former Launch Complex 13 at Cape Canaveral, now renamed Landing Zones 1



and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9 first-stage booster landings.[243] Later on, SpaceX will retire
these two landing zones and add three landing zones for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets to conduct to
"Return-to-launch-site" landings, two at LC-39A and one at SLC-40.[244][245][246]

Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4 (SLC-4E) was leased
from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar
orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and
Falcon Heavy vehicles,[247] but cannot launch to low
inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted to
Landing Zone 4 in 2015 for booster landings.[248]

On April 14, 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for
Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.[249] The pad
was subsequently modified to support Falcon 9 and Falcon SpaceX west coast launch facility at

Vandenberg Space Force Base, during
Heavy launches. As of 2024 it is the only pad that supports the launch of CASSIOPE
Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched its first crewed
mission to the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on May 30,
2020.[250] Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With
delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, Texas, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in
2022.[251]

Contracts
SpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts from NASA for the International Space Station
(ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified for U.S. military launches of
Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the
manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over $12 billion under contract.[70]

Cargo to ISS
In 2006, SpaceX won a NASA Commercial Orbital
Transportation Services (COTS) Phase 1 contract to
demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible
contract option for crew transport.[252] Through this contract,
designed by NASA to provide "seed money" through Space
Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid
SpaceX $396  million to develop the cargo configuration of
the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9
launch vehicle with their resources.[253] These Space Act
Agreements have been shown to have saved NASA millions
of dollars in development costs, making rocket development The COTS 2 Dragon is berthed to the
4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA International Space Station (ISS) by
alone.[254] Canadarm2



In December 2010, with the launch of the SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1 mission, SpaceX became the
first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.[255] Dragon successfully
berthed with the ISS during SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2 in May 2012, a first for a private
spacecraft.[256]

Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for
the delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS
contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded $1.6  billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions,
covering deliveries to 2016.[257] SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched
in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, before re-entering the
atmosphere and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[258]

CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the
Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the
contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.[259][257][260] The final Dragon 1 mission,
SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, and Dragon was subsequently retired from service. A
second phase of contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will
fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgraded Dragon 2 spacecraft.[261][262] In March 2020,
NASA contracted SpaceX to develop the Dragon XL spacecraft to send supplies to the Lunar Gateway
space station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[263]

Crewed
SpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA
astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts
started as part of the Commercial Crew Development
(CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially
operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to
the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in
2011,[264][265] followed by another in 2012 to
continue development and testing of its Dragon 2
spacecraft.[266]

In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing NASA astronauts inside the Dragon spacecraft
as the two companies that would be funded to develop during the Crew-1 mission rendezvous with the
systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the International Space Station

ISS.[267] SpaceX won $2.6  billion to complete and
certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA
astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract
required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[267]

SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, a Pad Abort Test, in May
2015,[268] and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the
ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[269] In January 2020, SpaceX conducted an in-flight
abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape
engines in a simulated abort scenario.[270]



On May 30, 2020, the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission was launched to the International Space Station
with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from
the U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS.[271] The Crew-1 mission
was successfully launched to the International Space Station on November 16, 2020, with NASA
astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker along with JAXA astronaut Soichi
Noguchi,[272] all members of the Expedition 64 crew.[273] On April 23, 2021, Crew-2 was launched to the
International Space Station with NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and K. Megan McArthur, JAXA
astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.[274] The Crew-2 mission successfully
docked on April 24, 2021.[275]

SpaceX also offers paid crewed spaceflights for
private individuals. The first of these missions,
Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf of Shift4
Payments CEO Jared Isaacman. The mission launched
the Crew Dragon Resilience from the Florida
Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A atop a
Falcon 9 launch vehicle, placed the Dragon capsule
into low Earth orbit, and ended successfully about
three days later when the Resilience splashed down in
the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received Resilience after splashdown
commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The
training included lessons in orbital mechanics,
operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission
simulations.[276]

National defense
In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)
contract, allowing the United States Air Force to purchase up to $100 million worth of launches from the
company.[277] Three years later, NASA announced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract
to SpaceX for up to $1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.[278] In December 2012,
SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with the United States Department of Defense (DoD).
The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center awarded SpaceX two EELV-class
missions: Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Space Test Program 2 (STP-2). DSCOVR
was launched on a Falcon 9 launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on a Falcon Heavy on
June 25, 2019.[279]

The Falcon 9 v1.1 was certified for National Security Space Launch (NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to
contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[161] This
broke the monopoly held since 2006 by United Launch Alliance (ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of
classified payloads.[280] In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch
to SpaceX to launch the second GPS III satellite for $82.7 million.[281] This was approximately 40% less
than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[282] SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch
on June 20, 2020.[283] In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional $290 million contract from the U.S.
Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[284]



The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) also
purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking
place on May 1, 2017.[285] In February 2019, SpaceX
secured a $297  million contract from the U.S. Air
Force to launch another three national security
missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY
2021.[286] In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force
awarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL)
contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a
contract for $316 million for one launch. In addition,
SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military's
satellite launch requirements over the period.[287]

SpaceX also designs and launches custom military
satellites for the Space Development Agency as part
of a new missile defense system in low Earth
orbit.[288] The constellation would give the United
States capabilities to sense, target and potentially
intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons
launched from anywhere on Earth.[289] Both China
and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations
about the program,[290] and various organizations
warn it could be destabilizing and trigger an arms race Launch of the STP-2 mission on a Falcon Heavy

in space.[291][292] in June 2019

In March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a
$1.8 billion contract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a
network of hundreds of spy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a
swarm in low orbits.[293]

In December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn't have access to government secrets.[294]

Launch market competition and pricing pressure
SpaceX's low launch prices, especially for communications satellites flying to geostationary transfer orbit
(GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[19] Prior to 2013,
the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying the Ariane 5) and
International Launch Services (flying the Proton).[295] With a published price of $56.5 million per launch
to low Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry.[296] European satellite
operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of the Ariane 5 and Ariane 6 rockets as a result of
competition from SpaceX.[297]

SpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to
compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy
launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch



orders.[298] To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease
launch costs by half.[299][300]

Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASA Space Act Agreement process of
"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to
industry" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially
lower cost. According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost
for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at $390 million. In 2011, NASA
estimated that it would have cost the agency about $4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster
based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[254] In May 2020, NASA
administrator Jim Bridenstine remarked that thanks to NASA's investments into SpaceX, the United
States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no
commercial launches from the country.[301]

As of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides
additional competition for small satellite launchers.[302]

Leadership changes
In November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice president Mark Juncosa
would oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw
operations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift
to its Cape Canaveral site. CNBC reported that these executive moves demonstrated "the sense of urgency
within the company to get Starship flying".[347][348][349]

Workplace culture

According to former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated
employee culture, similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.[350] In December 2021, claims of
workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers,
were published.[351] The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and
uncomfortable interactions.[352] Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture of sexual
harassment existing at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human
resources officers went largely unaddressed.[353]

In May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX
flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.[354] In
response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning "Elon's harmful Twitter
behavior".[355] It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX's "no-asshole" and "zero tolerance"
policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne
Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and
claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some
felt pressured to sign the letter.[356]



The company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work
excessively and is described as fostering a burnout culture.[357] According to a memo by Blue Origin, a
rival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying,[358][359][360]

SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.[357]

"SpaceX employees say they’re paying the price for the billionaire’s push to colonize space at breakneck
speed" reported Reuters in 2023. An examination of OSHA's records revealed injury rates higher than the
industry's averages. In addition, Reuters documented at least 600 previously unreported workplace
injuries at SpaceX, including "crushed limbs, amputations, electrocutions, head and eye wounds and one
death."[361] [362] The person who died was Lonnie LeBlanc, a former United States Marine.

In June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter
against Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and
discrimination.[363][364][365] The lawsuit has since stalled on headquarter jurisdiction grounds. [366][367]

Federal investigations
In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against SpaceX for discriminating
against refugees and asylum seekers in its hiring process, alleging that the company violated the
Immigration and Nationality Act by rejecting refugees and asylum recipients and hiring only U.S. citizens
and permanent residents.[368] SpaceX denied wrongdoing, citing U.S. export control law.[369] In February
2025, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.[369][370]

In December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well as Musk's alleged
drug use.[371][372]

Environmental impact
According to an investigation conducted by NPR, "SpaceX has sometimes ignored environmental
regulations as it rushed to fulfill its founder’s vision. With each of its launches, records show, the
company discharged tens of thousands of gallons of what regulators classify as industrial wastewater into
the surrounding environment."[373] In addition to endangering nearby people, the wastewater poses
significant threats to wildlife.[374]

The 2025 SpaceX Starship Flight 7 rocket explosion sent debris into the atmosphere that was spread
across the Caribbean Sea. The incident also "released significant amounts of harmful air pollution into the
upper layers of Earth's atmosphere."[375]
